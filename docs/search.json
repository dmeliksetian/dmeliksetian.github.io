You can expect technical deep dives and reflections on:\n\nQuantum Frontiers & QML: Exploring the transition from classical to quantum architectures. I will be discussing developments in Quantum Error Correction and Qiskit, with a specific focus on how AI and Machine Learning are being used to optimize quantum circuits and mitigate noise.\nThe Architecture of Innovation: Reflections on patenting, system design, and the methodologies that turn abstract ideas into scalable technologies. I will explore how Generative AI acts as a catalyst for invention and how it is fundamentally altering the software development lifecycle.\nThe AI-Augmented Workflow: Beyond the technology itself, I am interested in the meta-analysis of work. How are Large Language Models (LLMs) changing the way we code, write, and research? I will be documenting how AI is reshaping my own professional practices—from accelerating code generation to assisting in complex problem decomposition."
