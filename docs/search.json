    "text": "1. Representing an N-dimensional Vector\nIn the classical world, if I want to store a state vector \\(v\\) of size \\(N=4\\), I allocate an array of 4 floating-point numbers in memory:\n\\[\nv_{classical} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_0 \\\\ v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe memory requirement grows linearly with \\(N\\). However, in quantum problems, \\(N\\) represents the dimension of the Hilbert space, which grows exponentially with the number of particles or qubits (\\(N = 2^n\\)).\n\nThe Quantum Compression\nOn a quantum computer, we use Amplitude Encoding. We map the indices of the vector to the computational basis states of our qubits.\nTo represent a vector of size \\(N\\), we need only \\(n = \\log_2(N)\\) qubits. For our \\(N=4\\) example, we need just \\(n=2\\) qubits. The indices \\(0, 1, 2, 3\\) correspond to the binary states \\(|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\).\nThe vector \\(v\\) is then represented as the superposition state of the quantum system:\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = v_0|00\\rangle + v_1|01\\rangle + v_2|10\\rangle + v_3|11\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\nThe Constraint: Normalization\nThere is one strict constraint. In classical coding, a vector can have any magnitude. In quantum mechanics, probabilities must sum to 1. Therefore, the vector \\(|v\\rangle\\) must be normalized such that the sum of the squared absolute values of its coefficients equals 1:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |v_i|^2 = 1\n\\]\nThis means that our quantum state \\(|v\\rangle\\) is mathematically identical to the normalized vector \\(v\\) we discussed in the previous post. We aren’t “storing” the numbers \\(v_i\\) in digital memory addresses; the numbers \\(v_i\\) exist physically as the probability amplitudes of the wavefunction itself."

    "text": "2. Representing the NxN Matrix\nNow, what about the matrix \\(A\\)? Classically, \\(A\\) is a dense grid of numbers. If the vector has dimension \\(N=2^n\\), the matrix has \\((2^n)^2\\) entries. Storing a matrix for just 50 qubits would require more memory than exists on Earth.\nIn the quantum context, \\(A\\) represents an observable (usually a Hamiltonian). We do not store this matrix in the quantum computer’s memory. Instead, we represent it in the native language of the quantum processor: Pauli Strings.\n\nThe Decomposition\nThe set of Pauli matrices \\(\\{I, X, Y, Z\\}\\) forms a complete basis for the space of \\(2 \\times 2\\) Hermitian matrices. For a multi-qubit system, we use tensor products of these matrices (e.g., \\(Z \\otimes Z\\) or \\(X \\otimes I\\)).\nAny Hermitian matrix \\(A\\) can be written as a weighted sum of these Pauli strings:\n\\[\nA = \\sum_{j} c_j P_j\n\\]\nWhere \\(c_j\\) are real-valued scalar coefficients and \\(P_j\\) are Pauli strings.\n\n\nA Crucial Detail: Where do these strings come from?\nYou might be asking: “If the matrix \\(A\\) is too big to store, how do we calculate this decomposition?”\nThere are two scenarios:\n\nThe Mathematical Route: If we did have a small arbitrary matrix, we could mathematically decompose it using the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. We project the matrix onto each Pauli basis tensor to find the coefficients \\(c_j\\). However, doing this for large \\(N\\) defeats the purpose, as we would need to build the giant matrix first.\nThe Practical Route (Direct Mapping): In useful quantum applications (like Chemistry or Optimization), we never build the dense matrix.\n\nIn Chemistry: The interaction between electrons is described by the Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev transformations, which map the physical system directly into a sum of Pauli strings (\\(O(n^4)\\) terms) without ever creating a \\(2^n \\times 2^n\\) array.\nIn Optimization (MaxCut): The cost function of a graph cut maps directly to a sum of \\(Z_i Z_j\\) terms based on the graph’s edges.\n\n\nThis allows us to work with operators for 50+ qubits (a vector space of \\(10^{15}\\)) while only storing a polynomial number of Pauli terms in our laptop’s memory.\n\nNote: If these transformations sound complex, don’t worry. We will dedicate a future post in this series specifically to Problem Mapping—showing exactly how to turn a physical chemistry problem or a logistics graph into these Pauli strings without ever building the giant matrix.\n\n\n\nWhy This Solves the Complexity Problem\nThis representation changes the problem from “massive matrix multiplication” to “linear summation.”\nRecall that we want to calculate the expectation value \\(\\langle v | A | v \\rangle\\). Using the linearity of expectation, we can break this down:\n\\[\n\\langle v | A | v \\rangle = \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_j c_j P_j \\right) | v \\rangle = \\sum_j c_j \\langle v | P_j | v \\rangle\n\\]\nThis is the key to the efficiency of the algorithm. We don’t need a quantum computer that can “process” the giant matrix \\(A\\) all at once. We only need a quantum computer that can measure simple Pauli terms."

    "section": "3. Calculating the Expectation Value",
    "text": "3. Calculating the Expectation Value\nWe have defined our vector \\(|v\\rangle\\) and decomposed our matrix \\(A\\). Now comes the actual computation: calculating \\(\\langle v | P_j | v \\rangle\\). How do we actually ask a quantum computer for this number?\n\nA) The Manual Approach: Sampling Eigenvalues\nLet’s assume our Hamiltonian is just a single Pauli string, say \\(Z\\) on a single qubit. The expectation value is simply the weighted average of outcomes. We run the circuit, measure the qubit, and collect the bitstrings (e.g., 0, 0, 1, 0…). mapping 0 to \\(+1\\) and 1 to \\(-1\\).\nWhy this mapping? This isn’t arbitrary. It relies on the known spectral properties of Pauli matrices. The computational basis states \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \\(Z\\) operator, with eigenvalues \\(+1\\) and \\(-1\\) respectively:\n\\[Z|0\\rangle = (+1)|0\\rangle\\] \\[Z|1\\rangle = (-1)|1\\rangle\\]\nWhen we measure a qubit, we are collapsing it into one of these eigenstates. The value we associate with that outcome is the corresponding eigenvalue.\nExtending to Multi-Qubit Terms Crucially, the eigenvalue of a tensor product of Pauli matrices is simply the product of the eigenvalues of each individual matrix.\nFor example, if we are measuring the operator \\(Z \\otimes Z\\) on two qubits and we observe the state \\(|01\\rangle\\): * The first qubit is in \\(|0\\rangle\\) (eigenvalue \\(+1\\)). * The second qubit is in \\(|1\\rangle\\) (eigenvalue \\(-1\\)). * The total eigenvalue for this shot is \\((+1) \\times (-1) = -1\\).\nThis allows us to reconstruct the value of any complex Pauli string simply by multiplying the results of individual qubit measurements.\n\\[\\langle Z \\rangle \\approx \\frac{(+1) \\cdot N_0 + (-1) \\cdot N_1}{N_{total}}\\]\nWhat about X and Y? Quantum hardware generally only measures in the Z-basis. If our Pauli string contains an \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\), we cannot measure it directly. We must apply a basis rotation gate (like a Hadamard for \\(X\\)) just before measurement to align the axis with \\(Z\\).\n\n\nB) The Challenge: The Explosion of Terms\nIn a real problem, our matrix \\(A\\) might contain thousands of Pauli terms.\n\\[H = c_1 (Z_0 Z_1) + c_2 (X_0 X_1) + c_3 (Z_0 I_1) + \\dots\\]\nIf we were to run a separate quantum experiment (Sampler job) for every single term, the overhead would be astronomical.\nThe Solution: Operator Grouping Fortunately, we can exploit commutativity. If two Pauli strings commute (specifically, qubit-wise commutativity), they can be measured in the same basis simultaneously.\nFor example, \\(Z_0 Z_1\\) and \\(Z_0 I_1\\) both require the Z-basis. We can measure both in a single “shot”. However, \\(Z_0 Z_1\\) and \\(X_0 X_1\\) do not commute (Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle). You cannot measure Z and X on qubit 0 at the same time.\nTherefore, we group the thousands of Pauli strings into a small number of commuting families. We run one quantum job per family, effectively compressing thousands of measurements into a few dozen jobs.\n\n\nC) The Abstraction: The Qiskit Estimator\nDoing this efficiently involves significant bookkeeping: checking commutativity, grouping terms, appending rotations, and aggregating statistics.\nIn modern Qiskit, this is abstracted away by the Estimator. The Estimator is a primitive that takes the Circuit (state) and the Operator (matrix), handles the grouping and rotations internally, and returns the final floating-point expectation value."

However, we are going to use this example to illustrate how this problem can be mapped to a quantum system and how it produces an output.\n1. The Matrix Decomposition: We cannot load the \\(4 \\times 4\\) array into the QPU. We must break it down. Looking at the structure of \\(A\\): * The diagonal terms correspond to \\(Z \\otimes Z\\). * The off-diagonal terms correspond to \\(X \\otimes X\\).\nWe can rewrite \\(A\\) exactly as: \\[A = 0.5 (Z \\otimes Z) + 0.2 (X \\otimes X)\\]\n2. The Vector Construction: Quantum computers always start in the \\(|00\\rangle\\) state (the vector \\([1, 0, 0, 0]\\)). We need to build a circuit to transform this into our target vector \\(v\\). We can do this using \\(R_Y\\) (Rotation-Y) gates.\n\nApplying \\(R_Y(\\pi/3)\\) to qubit 0 creates amplitudes \\(\\approx [0.866, 0.5]\\).\nApplying \\(R_Y(\\pi/4)\\) to qubit 1 creates amplitudes \\(\\approx [0.924, 0.383]\\).\n\nThe tensor product of these rotations results in exactly our target vector \\([0.80, 0.46, 0.33, 0.19]\\).\n\nThe Quantum Code\nNow, let’s write the code to implement this mapping and verify the result matches our classical calculation.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp\nfrom qiskit.primitives import StatevectorEstimator\n\n# 1.

    "text": "I have released a new tutorial exploring one of the most counter-intuitive results in quantum mechanics: The Quantum Pigeonhole Paradox.\nClassically, the Pigeonhole Principle states that if you put three pigeons into two boxes, at least one box must contain more than one pigeon. In the quantum realm, however, using pre-selection and post-selection, we can construct a scenario where we can verify that no two particles share a box.\n\nWhat this Tutorial Covers\nIn this Qiskit 2.x notebook, we explore:\n\nThe Paradox Setup: Constructing the circuit for three particles and two boxes (states \\(|L\\rangle\\) and \\(|R\\rangle\\)).\nThe Measurement Problem: Demonstrating how a standard “strong” measurement collapses the state and destroys the paradox.\nWeak Measurements: Using a weak, reversible probe (Compute \\(\\rightarrow R_y(\\epsilon) \\rightarrow\\) Uncompute) to extract information without collapsing the interference pattern.\nInterference Recovery: Observing how the paradox re-emerges when we limit the disturbance to the system.\n\n\n\nKey Insight\nThis paradox forces us to reconsider the nature of trajectories and correlations in quantum systems. It demonstrates that “logic” about the past (e.g., “which box were they in?”) depends heavily on the measurement strength and the post-selection choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRun the Code\n\n\n\nThis tutorial is open-source and compatible with Qiskit 2.x.

    "section": "From Eigenvalues to Expectation Values",
    "text": "From Eigenvalues to Expectation Values\nWe traditionally encounter eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the solutions to the characteristic equation:\n\\[Ax = \\lambda x\\]\nIf we assume our vector \\(x\\) is normalized (has a length of 1), we can perform a simple manipulation. By multiplying both sides by the transpose of \\(x\\) (denoted as \\(x^T\\)), we can rewrite this relationship to isolate the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[x^T A x = \\lambda\\]\nIn many problems, particularly in physics and chemistry, we aren’t looking for just any eigenvalue; we are hunting for the lowest eigenvalue (the ground state energy). Let’s call this lowest eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_0\\), which corresponds to a specific eigenvector \\(x_0\\):\n\\[x_0^T A x_0 = \\lambda_0\\]\nThis concept can be visualized as a search on a complex energy landscape. Our goal is to navigate this landscape to find the absolute lowest point, the global minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Geometric interpretation of an energy landscape, showing optimization paths descending towards the global minimum (ground state).\n\n\n\nThis brings us to a fundamental property known as the Variational Principle. It states that if you take any arbitrary normalized vector \\(v\\) and compute this product, the result will always be greater than or equal to the lowest eigenvalue:\n\\[v^T A v \\ge \\lambda_0\\]\nIf you are interested in the mathematical rigor behind this principle, you can expand the section below for a step-by-step proof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProof: The Variational Principle (Click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prove that \\(v^T A v \\ge \\lambda_0\\), we rely on the Spectral Theorem. Since \\(A\\) represents a physical observable (like a Hamiltonian), it is a Hermitian matrix. This guarantees two things:\n\nAll its eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_i\\) are real.\nIts eigenvectors \\(\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}\\}\\) form a complete orthonormal basis.\n\nLet’s order the eigenvalues such that \\(\\lambda_0 \\le \\lambda_1 \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_{n-1}\\).\nSince the eigenvectors form a basis, any arbitrary vector \\(v\\) can be written as a linear combination of these eigenvectors:\n\\[v = \\sum_{i} c_i x_i\\]\nBecause \\(v\\) is normalized (\\(v^T v = 1\\)) and the basis is orthonormal (\\(x_i^T x_j = \\delta_{ij}\\)), the sum of the squared coefficients must equal 1:\n\\[\\sum_{i} |c_i|^2 = 1\\]\nNow, let’s look at the action of \\(A\\) on this expansion:\n\\[A v = A \\left( \\sum_{i} c_i x_i \\right) = \\sum_{i} c_i (A x_i) = \\sum_{i} c_i \\lambda_i x_i\\]\nNext, we calculate the expectation value \\(v^T A v\\):\n\\[v^T A v = \\left( \\sum_{j} c_j x_j \\right)^T \\left( \\sum_{i} c_i \\lambda_i x_i \\right)\\]\nDue to the orthonormality of the eigenvectors (the product \\(x_j^T x_i\\) is 1 if \\(i=j\\) and 0 otherwise), the cross-terms vanish, leaving us with a weighted sum of the eigenvalues:\n\\[v^T A v = \\sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \\lambda_i\\]\nHere is the crucial step. Since \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the smallest eigenvalue, we know that \\(\\lambda_i \\ge \\lambda_0\\) for all \\(i\\). Therefore, we can replace \\(\\lambda_i\\) with \\(\\lambda_0\\) to form an inequality:\n\\[\\sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \\lambda_i \\ge \\sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \\lambda_0\\]\nWe can factor out \\(\\lambda_0\\):\n\\[v^T A v \\ge \\lambda_0 \\left( \\sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \\right)\\]\nSince \\(\\sum |c_i|^2 = 1\\), the proof is complete:\n\\[v^T A v \\ge \\lambda_0\\]"

    "text": "Turning Algebra into Optimization\nThis inequality gives us a clear strategy. To find the lowest eigenvalue, we don’t need to analytically solve the matrix equation. Instead, we can treat it as a minimization game: we need to try different vectors \\(v\\) until we find the one that produces the lowest possible value for \\(v^T A v\\).\nHowever, trying vectors blindly is not efficient. The vector space is simply too vast. To make this manageable, we transform the search into an optimization problem.\nInstead of picking random vectors, we construct a vector that depends on a set of tunable scalar parameters. Let’s say we have a problem with \\(n\\) dimensions; theoretically, we need at most \\(n\\) parameters to explore the space. We can denote this parameterized vector as \\(v(\\theta)\\). By tweaking these \\(\\theta\\) parameters, we navigate the vector space, searching for the minimum value."

    "section": "The Complexity Barrier and the Quantum Solution",
    "text": "The Complexity Barrier and the Quantum Solution\nThis sounds straightforward enough to handle classically, so why do we need a quantum computer?\nThe problem lies in the complexity. As the system we are studying grows (for example, adding more atoms to a molecule), the dimension of the matrix \\(A\\) explodes exponentially. For a system that is still relatively small in physical terms, the vector \\(v\\) becomes so large that a classical supercomputer cannot even store it, let alone perform the matrix multiplications required to calculate \\(v^T A v\\).\nThe chart below illustrates this dramatic difference in scaling. While classical resources grow exponentially, a quantum algorithm like VQE offers a much more favorable polynomial scaling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of computational resource scaling for classical simulation (exponential) versus Quantum VQE (polynomial) as a function of system size.\n\n\n\nThis is where the quantum connection is made. In quantum mechanics, the expression \\(v^T A v\\) is written using Dirac notation as:\n\\[\\langle v | A | v \\rangle\\]\nThis is known as the quantum expectation value.\nWhile calculating this is a choking point for classical computers, it is a native operation for a quantum computer. We can prepare the state \\(|v\\rangle\\) on a quantum processor and measure the expectation value of the operator \\(A\\) directly. This allows us to evaluate our “cost function” efficiently, while a classical computer handles the task of updating the parameters \\(\\theta\\) to drive us toward the solution.\nNext Steps: In my next post, I will dive into the implementation details: specifically, how we efficiently create these parameterized vectors (the ansatz - German for ‘approach’ or ‘trial’) on actual quantum hardware, and the precise circuits required to measure the quantum expectation value \\(\\langle v | A | v \\rangle\\)."
