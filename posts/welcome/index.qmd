Welcome to my personal research blog.

After a career driving technical strategy as a Chief Architect and IBM Master Inventor, and now investigating the frontiers of computer science in academia, I find that the most interesting problems lie at the intersection of theory and practice.

## Focus Areas

This blog serves as a digital notebook for my ongoing research and intellectual explorations. You can expect technical deep dives and reflections on:

1.  **Quantum Frontiers & QML:** Exploring the transition from classical to quantum architectures. I will be discussing developments in Quantum Error Correction and Qiskit, with a specific focus on how **AI and Machine Learning** are being used to optimize quantum circuits and mitigate noise.

2.  **The Architecture of Innovation:** Reflections on patenting, system design, and the methodologies that turn abstract ideas into scalable technologies. I will explore how Generative AI acts as a catalyst for invention and how it is fundamentally altering the software development lifecycle.

3.  **The AI-Augmented Workflow:** Beyond the technology itself, I am interested in the *meta-analysis* of work. How are Large Language Models (LLMs) changing the way we code, write, and research? I will be documenting how AI is reshaping my own professional practices—from accelerating code generation to assisting in complex problem decomposition.

## Join the Conversation

I intend for this space to foster discussion with fellow researchers, industry practitioners, and anyone fascinated by the capabilities and limitations of computing systems.

I welcome your insights and feedback on these topics.
