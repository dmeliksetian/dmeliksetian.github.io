## Teaching Philosophy

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-8}
I believe education should mirror the collaborative environments where true innovation occurs.
My approach is modeled on the dynamic, innovative teams I led at IBM, where individuals of all skill levels learn implicitly from one another.
It's not just a matter of imprinting facts, but of fostering a conversation where students discover and appreciate concepts for themselves.
This philosophy of mutual discovery through discussion was central to how I mentored and coached junior team members across the globe.
**My objective is to foster these collaborative, discovery-oriented learning environments in every course I teach.**

"As a teacher or a technical lead, I get the most satisfaction when I see a student or a colleague reach that moment of sudden insight or discovery."
