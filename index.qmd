## About Me

My career has been dedicated to innovation—from software and cloud computing to machine learning and AI. After a long and rewarding journey at IBM as a Senior Technical Staff Member and Chief Architect, I've returned to my academic roots, having previously served on the faculties at Syracuse University and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

Throughout my time in the industry, I had the privilege of leading global teams, mentoring the next generation of technical talent in places like China and Brazil, and translating complex business needs into elegant, impactful technology solutions. Now, I am channeling that passion into the classroom and my personal research into the fascinating world of Quantum Computing.

## Quantum Explorations

My current intellectual passion lies at the intersection of classical and quantum computing.

### An Architect's View on Qubits
Moving from the certainty of classical bits to the probabilistic nature of qubits is a profound paradigm shift. It challenges every assumption about state management and error correction I've built over a career.

### First Steps with Qiskit
Running my first simple algorithm on an IBM quantum simulator was a fascinating experience. It's one thing to read about superposition and entanglement; it's another to see their effects.

### The Future is Hybrid
I believe the near-term future isn't purely quantum. The most exciting potential lies in hybrid systems where classical machines handle data and control flow, offloading specific calculations to quantum co-processors.
